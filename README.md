# GrÃ¶ngrÃ¤set Utility Billing System

A modern web application for managing utility billing for Swedish samfÃ¤llighetsfÃ¶rening (joint facility associations).

## Overview

This system replaces an Excel-based utility billing system with a comprehensive web application that supports:

- **Dynamic household management** - Any number of households with equal shares by default (andelstal removed)
- **Tertiary billing system** - streamlined to focus on 3 billing periods per year (every 4 months)
- **Volume-based utility billing** - all costs calculated based on consumption (mÂ³)
- **Multiple utility services** - water, electricity, heating, internet, membership fees
- **Reconciliation system** - main meters vs household meters with adjustments as separate line items
- **Role-based access** - ADMIN (full access) vs MEMBER (own household only)
- **Professional invoice generation** - PDF invoices with detailed cost breakdowns
- **Payment tracking** - mark bills as paid with full audit trail
- **Swedish localization** - proper currency formatting and Swedish terminology

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- **Node.js** with **Express.js** - REST API server
- **Prisma** - Database ORM and migration tool
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Zod** - Runtime type validation
- **JWT** - Authentication with refresh tokens
- **Puppeteer** - PDF generation for invoices

### Frontend

- **React** with **TypeScript** - User interface
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server
- **Material-UI (MUI)** - Component library
- **React Router** - Client-side routing
- **Date-fns** - Date manipulation with Swedish localization
- **Role-based routing** - Different interfaces for ADMIN vs MEMBER users

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **PostgreSQL** (v12 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Database Setup

1. **Start PostgreSQL with Docker:**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. **Alternative: Local PostgreSQL setup**
   - Create a PostgreSQL database named `greengrass`
   - Create a user with appropriate permissions
   - Update the `DATABASE_URL` in `backend/.env`

Example connection string:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/greengrass"
```

### Quick Start

1. **Clone and setup:**

   ```bash
   # Make sure you're in the project root directory
   cd greengrass
   ```

2. **Start development environment:**

   ```bash
   ./start-dev.sh
   ```

   This script will:

   - Install dependencies for both backend and frontend
   - Set up the database schema
   - Seed initial data
   - Start both development servers

3. **Access the application:**

   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3000

4. **Login credentials:**
   - **Admin:** admin@grongraset.se / admin123 (full access)
   - **Member:** member@grongraset.se / member123 (own household only)

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually:

#### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database connection
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
npx prisma db seed
npm run dev
```

#### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
